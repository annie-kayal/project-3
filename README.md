# KAP: Your Stay At Home Guide

## Overview 

KAP is the first full-stack app created during my time on GA's Software Engineering Immersive course, but was the third project overall. 

The app includes a RESTful API, built using Express, MongoDB, NodeJS and uses a React front-end. 

This was a **group project** which was to be completed in **nine days**.

Inspired by the Covid-19 lockdown, the app provides collections of activities which users can browse through whilst they are kept indoors. This includes books to read, recipies to cook, games to play and series or movies to watch. 

Browsing through the app can be done so by anybody who lands on the app, however more is available to users who create an account. 

When users do make an account, they are given their own profile page and have a variety of new functionality available to them: 

- Upload new activities to any of the collections

- Follow other users on the website

- Comment and rate on any of the activities to provide opinion and remove them if necessary

- Favourtise activities which can then be viewed on their profile page.


## The Brief 

* Work in a team, using **git to code collaboratively**.
* **Build a full-stack application** by building your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** using React
* **Be a complete product** have CRUD functionality implemented and a few models that have relationships.

## The Approach 

### Planning

- One of the first discussions which took place was the concept of our app. Between us all, we thought a topic that held relevacy was important to consider and with the lockdown having been implented fully only a few weeks before, it seemed like a good place to start. Another key deciding factor was if we wanted our app to limited to just one collection. Again, because lockdown limited how much could be accomplished for the public, we thought we would challenge ourselves by having a range of collections. Following this, we realised we wanted to make our content as rich as possible for users and we quickly started working on our models and collections. 

## Back-end

<h4>The app contained multiple collections and for the purpose of understanding the approach to building the content in the app, I have split this section into two. How the content was approached and the functionality for users who visit the page.</h4>

<h3 style='text-decoration: underline'> Collections </h3>

<h4>Models </h4>

- For our collections, we specified four models which utilises Mongoose which provides a built in Schema class. Each of these models are very detailed. This was so users could get a high level of detail from the app and so they knew it would suit their individual tastes.  

A Cook Schema for our recipes: 

```js
const cookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  ingredients: { type: Array, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 1000 },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  method: { type: Array, required: true },
  prepTime: { type: String, required: true },
  cookTime: { type: String, required: true },
  serves: { type: String, required: true },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  mealtype: { type: String, required: true },
  dietary: { type: Array, required: true },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ]
  
})

```

A Play Schema for the games: 

```js
const playSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 2000 },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  genre: { type: Array, required: true },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  subcategory: { type: String, required: true },
  players: { type: String, required: true },
  format: { type: String, required: false },
  duration: { type: String, required: false },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  link: { type: String, required: false },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ]
  
})
```

A Read Schema for books: 

```
const readSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  author: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 2000 },
  genre: { type: Array, required: true },
  bookType: { type: String, required: true },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ],
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true }

})
```

and finally a Watch Schema for movies and TV series:

```js
const watchSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 1000 },
  genre: { type: Array, required: true },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  trailer: { type: String, required: false },
  director: { type: String, required: false },
  duration: { type: String, required: false },
  seasons: { type: String, required: false },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  certification: { type: String, required: true },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  subcategory: { type: String, required: false },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ]
})
```

- All of these Schemas have a few feilds which are repeated:

  - User: This assigns a user to every activity and uses a **referenced** relationship 

  - Comments: Every activity has an array of comments, which is a **embedded**  relationship 

  - savedBy: This field is to identify which users saved that activity 

- Having decided our models, we could now move on to create the data for our app. This was implemented using a **seed file**. This file is hard-coded Recipies, Games, TV Series, Films and Books which was planted into our MongoDB. After completing this, we could look at building the end points for this API.

<h4>Router</h4>

We then procceded to create a `router.js` file to determine our API endpoints to how each of collections would be called on. Due to our Mongo database holding more than one collection, we specified 'category' as being as end point per collection which will be explained when discussing the controller. 

```js
router.route('/:category/:id')
  .get(itemController.singleItemId)
  .put(secureRoute, itemController.editActivity)
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addActivity)


router.route('/:category')
  .get(itemController.all)
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addActivity)


router.route('/:category/:id/comments')
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addNewComment)

router.route('/:category/:id/comments/:commentid')
  .put(secureRoute, itemController.editComment)
  .delete(secureRoute, itemController.deleteComment)
```

- These were the endpoints we created for our collections. As shown, each of these endpoints replies on a seperate function in our `itemController` file to retrive information from the database. 

<h4>Item Controller</h4>

To be able to access all of our collections easily, and keep the code DRY, we implemented our functions to be able to find on of collections through this method: 

```js
const category = req.params.category[0].toUpperCase() + req.params.category.slice(1)
```

 - In retriving our data, we noticed when we made requests that the collections we wanted access to had been assigned the names we chose in our seed file. However, in our requests, these names had been changed to all be lowercase and in order to access them, we needed to call the exact name, where the first letter was uppercase. Through the method outlined about, we took the request and changed the first letter to uppercase allowing us access to any of our collections. 

 - Having accomplished this, we were able to detail specific functions to access all of the data in our database or to find a specific activity by the id assigned to it. 

<h3 style='text-decoration: underline'> User </h3>

Our approach to the User model was to allow more functionality in the app once a person registered to the website, including commenting on activities, saving activities and uploading their own to the website. Due to this, the collection itself became complex due to the amount of functionality each user had. Weâ€™ll take you through step by step on how this approached: 

<h4>Models </h4>

As we did with the content for our app, the User required a model of its own for our MongoDB to store individuals successfully. While we were able to achieve many of our stretch goals during the project, we consistently made changes to the model throughout. Realistically speaking, this was not ideal and whilst building the model, all fields should've been added even if we did not accomplish them: 

```js
const schema = new mongoose.Schema({

  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, minLength: 8, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true, hide: true },
  firstname: { type: String, required: true },
  lastname: { type: String, required: false },
  interests: { type: Array, required: false, maxItems: 10 },
  uploads: { type: Array, required: true },
  savedItems: { type: Array, required: true },
  following: { type: Array, required: true },
  followedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  resetPasswordToken: { type: String, required: false }
}, {
  timestamps: true
})
```

Our goal was to be able to make the User as personal as possible. This was due to being able to make their individual profile pages as rich as possible without giving too much away about them. However, certain areas about the User need to be protected, including to us as the developers who had direct access to the database. In order to implement this, additional features were added to the model itself to protect Users: 

  1. Shown in the model above, the `username` and `email` fields have been distinguished as being `unique=True`. This was implemented using the Mongoose Unique Validator plugin whereby Users would be unable to register with the same email address or have an existing username. 

  2. We also used the Mongoose Hidden plugin for protecting the passwords of our users. Retrieving any user from the developer perspective reduces credibility to protecting data. Using this plugin, although we as the developers can access the users who are stored into the database, the password field would not be available to us. 

Mongoose itself has some incredibly powerful inbuilt methods which we also used in conjunction with Bcrypt for passwords. Using `pre`, we were able to access Mongoose Schemaâ€™s lifecycle methods and run functions when users register or login: 

- The first function we built was for checking the password and passwordConfirmation field match from the user input during registration. If these were not to match, it would invalid and halts the user would be prompted. 

- If during registration the first function is passed and accepted, the password entered would use bcrypt to encrypt the password before being stored into the database. If under any circumstance the database were to be hacked, this would make it difficult for hackers to decrypt the passwords for users. 

- The final function checks the credentials of a user at login. The function checks the password currently stored in the database and ensures this matches the user input.  

<h4>Secure Route & Router </h4>

Having built our model for the user, we could now build routes and endpoints specifically for users. Some of these endpoints are specifically designed for users who are in the database and some which are available for users without an account. 

The functionality associated per endpoint is defined in our **userController.js**. In this file, we defined functions to how requests were made to the API and what responses would be given if they were accepted or not. 

Shown below are the endpoints accessible for ALL users and what functionality they allow 

```js  
router.route('/register')
  .post(userController.registerUser)
```
- A single POST request where the request must match the fields of the User model which are listed as `required`. If these are not met, registeration will respond with unsuccessful.
---
```js
router.route('/login')
  .post(userController.login)
```
```js
router.route('/reset/')
  .get(userController.checkResetToken)
```
```js
router.route('/updatePassword')
  .put(userController.updatePassword)
```
```js
router.route('/user/:id')
  .get(userController.singleUserId)
```
```js
router.route('/:category/:id')
  .get(itemController.singleItemId)
```
```js
router.route('/:category')
  .get(itemController.all)
```



  - /register: 
    - A single POST request where the request must match the fields of the User model which are listed as `required`. If these are not met, registeration will respond with unsuccessful.
  - /login: 
    - A single POST request to find a user by the given email address given at registration and validate the password. If successful, the user is provided with a token using JWT. 

  - /reset/: 
    - In the instance a user may have forgotten their password and would link it to be reset, this GET endpoint would be used. Here, an email wouldâ€™ve been sent to the user with the email address they originally registered with and provided a new token. This endpoint validates if the token is still valid in order for the password to be reset.  

  - /updatePassword: 
    - This PUT request is used to allow a user to reset their password. Once the /reset/ endpoint has succeeded, users would be taken to a page and once submitted would check if a user with their username exists in the database. If found, their new password is encrypted using bcrypt and stored into the database. 




And the ones which are strictly for those with an account:
