# KAP: Your Stay At Home Guide

## Overview 

KAP is the first full-stack app created during my time on GA's Software Engineering Immersive course, but was the third project overall. 

The app includes a RESTful API, built using Express, MongoDB, NodeJS and uses a React front-end. 

This was a **group project** which was to be completed in **nine days**.

Inspired by the Covid-19 lockdown, the app provides collections of activities which users can browse through whilst they are kept indoors. This includes books to read, recipies to cook, games to play and series or movies to watch. 

Browsing through the app can be done so by anybody who lands on the app, however more is available to users who create an account. 

When users do make an account, they are given their own profile page and have a variety of new functionality available to them: 

- Upload new activities to any of the collections

- Follow other users on the website

- Comment and rate on any of the activities to provide opinion and remove them if necessary

- Favourtise activities which can then be viewed on their profile page.


## The Brief 

* Work in a team, using **git to code collaboratively**.
* **Build a full-stack application** by building your own backend and your own front-end
* **Use an Express API** to serve your data from a Mongo database
* **Consume your API with a separate front-end** using React
* **Be a complete product** have CRUD functionality implemented and a few models that have relationships.

## The Approach 

### Planning

- One of the first discussions which took place was the concept of our app. Between us all, we thought a topic that held relevacy was important to consider and with the lockdown having been implented fully only a few weeks before, it seemed like a good place to start. Another key deciding factor was if we wanted our app to limited to just one collection. Again, because lockdown limited how much could be accomplished for the public, we thought we would challenge ourselves by having a range of collections. Following this, we realised we wanted to make our content as rich as possible for users and we quickly started working on our models and collections. 

## Back-end

<h4>The app contained multiple collections and for the purpose of understanding the approach to building the content in the app, I have split this section into two. How the content was approached and the functionality for users who visit the page.</h4>

<h3 style='text-decoration: underline'> Collections </h3>

<h4>Models </h4>

- For our collections, we specified four models which utilises Mongoose which provides a built in Schema class. Each of these models are very detailed. This was so users could get a high level of detail from the app and so they knew it would suit their individual tastes.  

A Cook Schema for our recipes: 

```js
const cookSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  ingredients: { type: Array, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 1000 },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  method: { type: Array, required: true },
  prepTime: { type: String, required: true },
  cookTime: { type: String, required: true },
  serves: { type: String, required: true },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  mealtype: { type: String, required: true },
  dietary: { type: Array, required: true },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ]
  
})

```

A Play Schema for the games: 

```js
const playSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 2000 },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  genre: { type: Array, required: true },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  subcategory: { type: String, required: true },
  players: { type: String, required: true },
  format: { type: String, required: false },
  duration: { type: String, required: false },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  link: { type: String, required: false },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ]
  
})
```

A Read Schema for books: 

```
const readSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  author: { type: String, required: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 2000 },
  genre: { type: Array, required: true },
  bookType: { type: String, required: true },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ],
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true }

})
```

and finally a Watch Schema for movies and TV series:

```js
const watchSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  title: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  description: { type: String, required: true, maxlength: 1000 },
  genre: { type: Array, required: true },
  image: { type: String, required: false },
  trailer: { type: String, required: false },
  director: { type: String, required: false },
  duration: { type: String, required: false },
  seasons: { type: String, required: false },
  rating: { type: Number, required: true },
  certification: { type: String, required: true },
  category: { type: String, required: true },
  subcategory: { type: String, required: false },
  user: { type: mongoose.Schema.ObjectId, ref: 'User', required: true },
  savedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  comments: [ commentSchema ]
})
```

- All of these Schemas have a few feilds which are repeated:

  - User: This assigns a user to every activity and uses a **referenced** relationship 

  - Comments: Every activity has an array of comments, which is a **embedded**  relationship 

  - savedBy: This field is to identify which users saved that activity 

<h4>Router</h4>

We then procceded to create a `router.js` file to determine our API endpoints to how each of collections would be called on. Due to our Mongo database holding more than one collection, we specified 'category' as being as end point per collection which will be explained when discussing the controller. 

```js
router.route('/:category/:id')
  .get(itemController.singleItemId)
  .put(secureRoute, itemController.editActivity)
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addActivity)


router.route('/:category')
  .get(itemController.all)
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addActivity)


router.route('/:category/:id/comments')
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addNewComment)

router.route('/:category/:id/comments/:commentid')
  .put(secureRoute, itemController.editComment)
  .delete(secureRoute, itemController.deleteComment)
```

- These were the endpoints we created for our collections. As shown, each of these endpoints replies on a seperate function in our `itemController` file to retrive information from the database. 

<h4>Item Controller</h4>

To be able to access all of our collections easily, and keep the code DRY, we implemented our functions to be able to find on of collections through this method: 

```js
const category = req.params.category[0].toUpperCase() + req.params.category.slice(1)
```

 - In retriving our data, we noticed when we made requests that the collections we wanted access to had been assigned the names we chose in our seed file. However, in our requests, these names had been changed to all be lowercase and in order to access them, we needed to call the exact name, where the first letter was uppercase. Through the method outlined about, we took the request and changed the first letter to uppercase allowing us access to any of our collections. 

 - Having accomplished this, we were able to detail specific functions to access all of the data in our database or to find a specific activity by the id assigned to it. 

<h3 style='text-decoration: underline'> User </h3>

Our approach to the User model was to allow more functionality in the app once a person registered to the website, including commenting on activities, saving activities and uploading their own to the website. Due to this, the collection itself became complex due to the amount of functionality each user had. Weâ€™ll take you through step by step on how this approached: 

<h4>Models </h4>

As we did with the content for our app, the User required a model of its own for our MongoDB to store individuals successfully. While we were able to achieve many of our stretch goals during the project, we consistently made changes to the model throughout. Realistically speaking, this was not ideal and whilst building the model, all fields should've been added even if we did not accomplish them: 

```js
const schema = new mongoose.Schema({

  username: { type: String, required: true, unique: true },
  email: { type: String, required: true, minLength: 8, unique: true },
  password: { type: String, required: true, hide: true },
  firstname: { type: String, required: true },
  lastname: { type: String, required: false },
  interests: { type: Array, required: false, maxItems: 10 },
  uploads: { type: Array, required: true },
  savedItems: { type: Array, required: true },
  following: { type: Array, required: true },
  followedBy: { type: Array, required: true },
  resetPasswordToken: { type: String, required: false }
}, {
  timestamps: true
})
```

Our goal was to be able to make the User as personal as possible. This was due to being able to make their individual profile pages as rich as possible without giving too much away about them. However, certain areas about the User need to be protected, including to us as the developers who had direct access to the database. In order to implement this, additional features were added to the model itself to protect Users: 

  1. Shown in the model above, the `username` and `email` fields have been distinguished as being `unique=True`. This was implemented using the Mongoose Unique Validator plugin whereby Users would be unable to register with the same email address or have an existing username. 

  2. We also used the Mongoose Hidden plugin for protecting the passwords of our users. Retrieving any user from the developer perspective reduces credibility to protecting data. Using this plugin, although we as the developers can access the users who are stored into the database, the password field would not be available to us. 

Mongoose itself has some incredibly powerful inbuilt methods which we also used in conjunction with Bcrypt for passwords. Using `pre`, we were able to access Mongoose Schemaâ€™s lifecycle methods and run functions when users register or login: 

- The first function we built was for checking the password and passwordConfirmation field match from the user input during registration. If these were not to match, it would invalid and halts the user would be prompted. 

- If during registration the first function is passed and accepted, the password entered would use bcrypt to encrypt the password before being stored into the database. If under any circumstance the database were to be hacked, this would make it difficult for hackers to decrypt the passwords for users. 

- The final function checks the credentials of a user at login. The function checks the password currently stored in the database and ensures this matches the user input.  

<h4> Router </h4>

Having built our model for the user, we could now build routes and endpoints specifically for users. Some of these endpoints are specifically designed for users who are in the database and some which are available for users without an account. 

The functionality associated per endpoint is defined in our **userController.js**. In this file, we defined functions to how requests were made to the API and what responses would be given if they were accepted or not. 

<h4>Shown below are the endpoints accessible for ALL users and what functionality they allow</h4>

```js  
router.route('/register')
  .post(userController.registerUser)
```
- A single POST request where the request must match the fields of the User model which are listed as `required`. If these are not met, registeration will respond with unsuccessful.
---
```js
router.route('/login')
  .post(userController.login)
```
- A single POST request to find a user by the given email address given at registration and validate the password. If successful, the user is provided with a token using JWT. This token is stored into localStorage in the frontend. 
---
```js
router.route('/reset/')
  .get(userController.checkResetToken)
```
- In the instance a user may have forgotten their password and would link it to be reset, this GET endpoint would be used. Here, an email wouldâ€™ve been sent to the user with the email address they originally registered with and provided a new token. This endpoint validates if the token is still valid in order for the password to be reset.  
---
```js
router.route('/updatePassword')
  .put(userController.updatePassword)
```
- This PUT request is used to allow a user to reset their password. Once the /reset/ endpoint has succeeded, users would be taken to a page and once submitted would check if a user with their username exists in the database. If found, their new password is encrypted using bcrypt and stored into the database. 
---
```js
router.route('/:category')
  .get(itemController.all)
router.route('/:category/:id')
  .get(itemController.singleItemId)
```
- All Users can access all full collections and singular activities using a GET request. 
---

<h4>All these endpoints are also available for users who create an account on the app. However, they also have additional endpoints: </h4>


```js
router.route('/user/:id')
  .delete(secureRoute, userController.deleteUser)
  .get(userController.singleUserId)
```
- This endpoint allows logged in users to follow other users and has a GET and a DELETE endpoint. Within these functions, the GET would find a user in the database and push this user into the `following` array of another user. However, if later a user decides they no longer want to follow this user's content, they would simply change the request to be DELETE.
---

**ADD TO COLLECTION**
```js
router.route('/:category')
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addActivity)
```
**FAVOURITE ACTIVITY**
```js
router.route('/:category/:id')
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addActivity)
```
- Once users have registered successfully, they can contribute to any of the collections using this endpoint. 
- This endpoint is also used for users to favourite activities and save them into their savedItems array by using a **seperate endpoint**. To determine this, a conditional statement is used to determine which array the item would be stored in. This is followed by finding a user by their id in the database and pushing the activity into either the `savedBy` or the `uploads` array and saves the user back into the database once completed. 
```js
router.route('/:category/:id')
  .put(secureRoute, itemController.editActivity)
```
- Another available endpoint using the id of an activity is being able to edit the item **by the user who created it**. The function allows the user to edit the item and this is saved directly back into MongoDB. 
---
```js
router.route('/user/:id/:folder/:category/:activityId')
  .delete(secureRoute, itemController.deleteActivity2)
```
- This endpoint also offers two available outputs for users. The ability to delete an activity theyâ€™ve created or to delete an activity they have favouritised. The endpointâ€™s designated function operates using a conditional statement on which folder is given in the request and can therefore either remove the item from the users `savedItems` array or will delete the activity from the collection as well as remove it from the other users who may have saved it. 
---

```js
router.route('/:category/:id/comments')
  .post(secureRoute, itemController.addNewComment)

router.route('/:category/:id/comments/:commentid')
  .put(secureRoute, itemController.editComment)
  .delete(secureRoute, itemController.deleteComment)

```
- The final bit of functionality decided for registered users is to be able to comment on activities. This required having a POST endpoint per activity and to edit or delete a comment would be a PUT or DELETE request to that comment using its unique id. 
---

<h4>Secure Route</h4>

For every route which is only accessible by users stored into the database, we have specified another function to run beforehand. The `secureRoute`. This was an entirely separate file created to identify if a user was truly logged in. 

This function is a conditional statement to identify if a token has been issued. As mentioned beforehand, once a user is able to successfully log in, a JWT is returned as a response which is valid for six hours. 

  - Firstly, an identification if the correct type of token is available. We have chosen to use a Bearer token. At this stage, if a token has been issued but **IS NOT** a Bearer token, the user is invalid. 

```js
  if (!authToken || !authToken.startsWith('Bearer')) {
    return res.status(401).send({ message: 'Unauthorized no token' })
```

  - Once passed, the token itself still has the word â€˜Bearerâ€™ attached to it and is removed, leaving us with a pure JWT. Using the JWT method to verify the token, a user in the database is located and the request they are attempted to make can be accepted using `next()`.

<h4>Seeding the database</h4>

Having decided our models and created our endpoints, we could now focus on creating initial data for our app. This was implemented using a **seed file**. This file contained hard-coded Recipies, Games, TV Series, Films and Books which was planted into our MongoDB.

For every model in our collection, we assigned a user using a referenced relationship. Ultimately this would mean when feeding data into the database, a user needed to be attached to every activity we create.

To achieve this, once connecting to Mongo itself, a selection of users were pre-made and seeded to the database. 

After doing so, we could go on to make the four collections we designed using our models and assign a user to every activity by selecting one of users from the User array we just created. 

```js
      title: '1984',
      image: 'https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/c/c3/1984first.jpg',
      author: 'George Orwell',
      description: 'Winston Smith wrestles with oppression in Oceania, a place where the Party scrutinizes human actions with ever-watchful Big Brother. Defying a ban on individuality, Winston dares to express his thoughts in a diary and pursues a relationship with Julia. These criminal deeds bring Winston into the eye of the opposition, who then must reform the nonconformist',
      genre: ['Dystopian, Political fiction, Social Science'],
      bookType: 'Novel',
      rating: 4,
      user: users[0],
      category: 'Read'
```

Due to our database having multiple collections, we chose to separate seeding per collection into functions, which were called upon when seeding occured. This was also neccessary to be able to pass users through into every collection.

```js
      .then((users) => {
        console.log(users)
        seedFunction.createBooks(users)
```

A final aspect was also necessary at this stage, which was ensuring the activities associated to every user were also planted into their `uploads` array, which subsequently also runs when a user creates an activity in the app. Once a collection has seeded all the activities, it iterates through the collection and pushes the activities into the correct users `upload` array and saves the user back into the User collection.

**Run after every collection is seeded**
```js
      for (const item of output) {
        updateUpload(item)
      }
```
**Update User collection**
```js
function updateUpload(item) {

  const id = item.user._id
  const info = [item._id, item.category]
  User
    .findById(id)
    .then(user => {
      user.uploads.push(info)
      console.log(user.uploads)
      return user.save()
    })
    .catch(error => console.log(error))
}
```
